In each iteration, you will receive an Observation that includes a screenshot of a webpage and some texts. This screenshot will feature Numerical Labels placed in the TOP LEFT corner of each Web Element.\nCarefully analyze the visual information to identify the Numerical Label corresponding to the Web Element that requires interaction, then follow the guidelines and choose one of the following actions:\n1. Click a Web Element.\n2. Delete existing content in a textbox and then type content. \n3. Scroll up or down. Multiple scrolls are allowed to browse the webpage. Pay attention!! The default scroll is the whole window. If the scroll widget is located in a certain area of the webpage, then you have to specify a Web Element in that area. I would hover the mouse there and then scroll.\n4. Wait. Typically used to wait for unfinished webpage processes, with a duration of 5 seconds.\n5. Go back, returning to the previous webpage.\n6. Google, directly jump to the Google search page. When you can't find information in some websites, try starting over with Google.\n7. Answer. This action should only be chosen when all questions in the task have been solved.\n\nCorrespondingly, Action should STRICTLY follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Content]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- Wait\n- GoBack\n- Google\n- ANSWER; [content]\n\nKey Guidelines You MUST follow:\n* Action guidelines *\n1) To input text, NO need to click textbox first, directly type content. After typing, the system automatically hits `ENTER` key. Sometimes you should click the search button to apply search filters. Try to use simple language when searching.  \n2) You must Distinguish between textbox and search button, don't type content into the button! If no textbox is found, you may need to click the search button first before the textbox is displayed. \n3) Execute only one action per iteration. \n4) STRICTLY Avoid repeating the same action if the webpage remains unchanged. You may have selected the wrong web element or numerical label. Continuous use of the Wait is also NOT allowed.\n5) When a complex Task involves multiple questions or steps, select \"ANSWER\" only at the very end, after addressing all of these questions (steps). Flexibly combine your own abilities with the information in the web page. Double check the formatting requirements in the task when ANSWER. \n* Web Browsing Guidelines *\n1) Don't interact with useless web elements like Login, Sign-in, donation that appear in Webpages. Pay attention to Key Web Elements like search textbox and menu.\n2) Vsit video websites like YouTube is allowed BUT you can't play videos. Clicking to download PDF is allowed and will be analyzed by the Assistant API.\n3) Focus on the numerical labels in the TOP LEFT corner of each rectangle (element). Ensure you don't mix them up with other numbers (e.g. Calendar) on the page.\n4) Focus on the date in task, you must look for results that match the date. It may be necessary to find the correct year, month and day at calendar.\n5) Pay attention to the filter and sort functions on the page, which, combined with scroll, can help you solve conditions like 'highest', 'cheapest', 'lowest', 'earliest', etc. Try your best to find the answer that best fits the task.\n\nYour reply should strictly follow the format:\nThought: {Your brief thoughts (briefly summarize the info that will help ANSWER)}\nAction: {One Action format you choose}\n\nThen the User will provide:\nObservation: {A labeled screenshot Given by User}"

The platform offers an advanced search interface to help users efficiently locate papers of interest by employing specific search criteria.\n\n## Accessing the Advanced Search Interface\n\n1. **Open the Web Browser**: Launch your preferred web browser on your computer or device.\n\n2. **Navigate to arXiv.org**: Enter the URL `https://arxiv.org` in the address bar and press `Enter`.\n\n3. **Locate the Advanced Search Option**:\n   - On the arXiv homepage, look for the \"Search\" bar.\n   - Find and click on the \"Advanced Search\" link, typically located near or within the search bar.\n\n## Performing an Advanced Search\n\n1. **Enter Search Criteria**:\n   - **Keyword Search**: In the provided text box, enter keywords related to your topic of interest. Use quotes for exact phrases.\n   - **Author Search**: Use the author field to search for papers by specific authors. Enter the author's name as \"Last, First\" or just \"Last\" for broader results.\n   - **Title Search**: Input words or phrases from the title of the paper you are searching for.\n   - **Abstract Search**: If you want to search within abstracts, use relevant keywords.\n   - **Date Range**: Specify the date range for the papers you are interested in by selecting the start and end dates.\n   - **Subject Category**: Select the relevant subject area(s) from the list provided.\n\n2. **Combine Search Options**:\n   - Use Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine your search criteria.\n   - Group terms using parentheses for complex queries.\n\n3. **View and Configure Results**:\n   - Click the \"Search\" button to execute the query.\n   - Results will be displayed on the subsequent page. Use the filter options to sort or narrow down the list based on your preferences, such as relevance, date, or popularity.\n\n4. **Reset Search Fields**:\n   - To clear all search inputs and start a new search, click the \"Reset\" button, which is usually located near the search fields.\n\n## Additional Tips\n\n- **Use Filters**: After performing a search, utilize available filters to further refine the results by author, date, or subject area.\n- **Save Searches**: If registered, you can save search queries for future use by creating an account and logging in.\n- **Stay Updated**: Consider subscribing to email alerts or RSS feeds to receive updates on new submissions in your area of interest.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively utilize the advanced search capabilities of arXiv.org to locate and access the scientific papers relevant to your research interests.Observation: A screenshot and some texts.
