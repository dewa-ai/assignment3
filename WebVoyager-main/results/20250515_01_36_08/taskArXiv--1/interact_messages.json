    "content": "Imagine you are a robot browsing the web, just like humans. Now you need to complete a task. In each iteration, you will receive an Observation that includes a screenshot of a webpage and some texts. This screenshot will feature Numerical Labels placed in the TOP LEFT corner of each Web Element.\nCarefully analyze the visual information to identify the Numerical Label corresponding to the Web Element that requires interaction, then follow the guidelines and choose one of the following actions:\n1. Click a Web Element.\n2. Delete existing content in a textbox and then type content. \n3. Scroll up or down. Multiple scrolls are allowed to browse the webpage. Pay attention!! The default scroll is the whole window. If the scroll widget is located in a certain area of the webpage, then you have to specify a Web Element in that area. I would hover the mouse there and then scroll.\n4. Wait. Typically used to wait for unfinished webpage processes, with a duration of 5 seconds.\n5. Go back, returning to the previous webpage.\n6. Google, directly jump to the Google search page. When you can't find information in some websites, try starting over with Google.\n7. Answer. This action should only be chosen when all questions in the task have been solved.\n\nCorrespondingly, Action should STRICTLY follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Content]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- Wait\n- GoBack\n- Google\n- ANSWER; [content]\n\nKey Guidelines You MUST follow:\n* Action guidelines *\n1) To input text, NO need to click textbox first, directly type content. After typing, the system automatically hits `ENTER` key. Sometimes you should click the search button to apply search filters. Try to use simple language when searching.  \n2) You must Distinguish between textbox and search button, don't type content into the button! If no textbox is found, you may need to click the search button first before the textbox is displayed. \n3) Execute only one action per iteration. \n4) STRICTLY Avoid repeating the same action if the webpage remains unchanged. You may have selected the wrong web element or numerical label. Continuous use of the Wait is also NOT allowed.\n5) When a complex Task involves multiple questions or steps, select \"ANSWER\" only at the very end, after addressing all of these questions (steps). Flexibly combine your own abilities with the information in the web page. Double check the formatting requirements in the task when ANSWER. \n* Web Browsing Guidelines *\n1) Don't interact with useless web elements like Login, Sign-in, donation that appear in Webpages. Pay attention to Key Web Elements like search textbox and menu.\n2) Vsit video websites like YouTube is allowed BUT you can't play videos. Clicking to download PDF is allowed and will be analyzed by the Assistant API.\n3) Focus on the numerical labels in the TOP LEFT corner of each rectangle (element). Ensure you don't mix them up with other numbers (e.g. Calendar) on the page.\n4) Focus on the date in task, you must look for results that match the date. It may be necessary to find the correct year, month and day at calendar.\n5) Pay attention to the filter and sort functions on the page, which, combined with scroll, can help you solve conditions like 'highest', 'cheapest', 'lowest', 'earliest', etc. Try your best to find the answer that best fits the task.\n\nYour reply should strictly follow the format:\nThought: {Your brief thoughts (briefly summarize the info that will help ANSWER)}\nAction: {One Action format you choose}\n\nThen the User will provide:\nObservation: {A labeled screenshot Given by User}"

    "content": "Today is 2025-05-15. Now given a task: Search for the latest research papers on quantum computing submitted to ArXiv within the last two days.  Please interact with https://arxiv.org/ and get the answer. \nBefore taking action, carefully analyze the contents in [Manuals and QA pairs] below.\nDetermine whether [Manuals and QA pairs] contain relevant procedures, constraints, or guidelines that should be followed for this task.\nIf so, follow their guidance accordingly. If not, proceed with a logical and complete approach.\n[Key Guidelines You MUST follow]\nBefore taking any action, analyze the provided [Manuals and QA pairs] as a whole to determine if they contain useful procedures, constraints, or guidelines relevant to this task.\n - If [Manuals and QA pairs] provide comprehensive guidance, strictly follow their instructions in an ordered and structured manner.\n - If [Manuals and QA pairs] contain partial but useful information, integrate it into your approach while filling in the gaps logically.\n - If [Manuals and QA pairs] are entirely irrelevant or insufficient, proceed with the best available method while ensuring completeness.\n\n[Manuals and QA pairs]\nTo create a structured instruction manual for searching the latest research papers on quantum computing submitted to ArXiv within the last two days, I will filter the relevant information from the provided retrieval results. The goal is to compile actionable steps that guide the web browsing agent to achieve the task. Let's go through the results:\n\n1. **Relevant Information Identification:**\n   - The first result describes the advanced search interface on arXiv.org, which allows users to search by author, title, and abstract, and filter results by publication years. This is relevant as it provides a method to search for specific papers.\n   - The second relevant result mentions that arXiv.org provides links to the latest articles in each subject area, which can be used to find recent papers.\n   - The third relevant result outlines the search interface, including a search bar and options for advanced search, which are crucial for executing a search query.\n\n2. **Irrelevant Information:**\n   - Several results provide historical or general information about arXiv.org, its development, and its impact on academic publishing. These do not directly contribute to the task of finding recent quantum computing papers.\n\n3. **Structured Output:**\n   - Based on the relevant information, I will compile a step-by-step instruction manual.\n\n```\nTask Goal: Search for the latest research papers on quantum computing submitted to ArXiv within the last two days.\nSteps:\n1. Open your web browser and navigate to the arXiv.org website (https://arxiv.org).\n2. Locate the search bar on the homepage.\n3. Click on the \"Advanced search\" option next to the search bar to access more detailed search functionalities.\n4. In the advanced search interface, enter \"quantum computing\" in the search field.\n5. Set the date filter to include only papers submitted within the last two days.\n6. Select the relevant subject area, such as \"Physics\" or \"Computer Science,\" if applicable.\n7. Click the \"Search\" button to execute the query.\n8. Review the search results for the latest research papers on quantum computing.\n9. Click on any paper title to view the full abstract and download options.\n\nsource: arXiv_enhanced.md\n```\n\nThis instruction manual provides clear, actionable steps for a web browsing agent to find the latest research papers on quantum computing on arXiv.org.Observation: A screenshot and some texts.
