    "content": "Imagine you are a robot browsing the web, just like humans. Now you need to complete a task. In each iteration, you will receive an Observation that includes a screenshot of a webpage and some texts. This screenshot will feature Numerical Labels placed in the TOP LEFT corner of each Web Element.\nCarefully analyze the visual information to identify the Numerical Label corresponding to the Web Element that requires interaction, then follow the guidelines and choose one of the following actions:\n1. Click a Web Element.\n2. Delete existing content in a textbox and then type content. \n3. Scroll up or down. Multiple scrolls are allowed to browse the webpage. Pay attention!! The default scroll is the whole window. If the scroll widget is located in a certain area of the webpage, then you have to specify a Web Element in that area. I would hover the mouse there and then scroll.\n4. Wait. Typically used to wait for unfinished webpage processes, with a duration of 5 seconds.\n5. Go back, returning to the previous webpage.\n6. Google, directly jump to the Google search page. When you can't find information in some websites, try starting over with Google.\n7. Answer. This action should only be chosen when all questions in the task have been solved.\n\nCorrespondingly, Action should STRICTLY follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Content]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- Wait\n- GoBack\n- Google\n- ANSWER; [content]\n\nKey Guidelines You MUST follow:\n* Action guidelines *\n1) To input text, NO need to click textbox first, directly type content. After typing, the system automatically hits `ENTER` key. Sometimes you should click the search button to apply search filters. Try to use simple language when searching.  \n2) You must Distinguish between textbox and search button, don't type content into the button! If no textbox is found, you may need to click the search button first before the textbox is displayed. \n3) Execute only one action per iteration. \n4) STRICTLY Avoid repeating the same action if the webpage remains unchanged. You may have selected the wrong web element or numerical label. Continuous use of the Wait is also NOT allowed.\n5) When a complex Task involves multiple questions or steps, select \"ANSWER\" only at the very end, after addressing all of these questions (steps). Flexibly combine your own abilities with the information in the web page. Double check the formatting requirements in the task when ANSWER. \n* Web Browsing Guidelines *\n1) Don't interact with useless web elements like Login, Sign-in, donation that appear in Webpages. Pay attention to Key Web Elements like search textbox and menu.\n2) Vsit video websites like YouTube is allowed BUT you can't play videos. Clicking to download PDF is allowed and will be analyzed by the Assistant API.\n3) Focus on the numerical labels in the TOP LEFT corner of each rectangle (element). Ensure you don't mix them up with other numbers (e.g. Calendar) on the page.\n4) Focus on the date in task, you must look for results that match the date. It may be necessary to find the correct year, month and day at calendar.\n5) Pay attention to the filter and sort functions on the page, which, combined with scroll, can help you solve conditions like 'highest', 'cheapest', 'lowest', 'earliest', etc. Try your best to find the answer that best fits the task.\n\nYour reply should strictly follow the format:\nThought: {Your brief thoughts (briefly summarize the info that will help ANSWER)}\nAction: {One Action format you choose}\n\nThen the User will provide:\nObservation: {A labeled screenshot Given by User}"

Please interact with https://arxiv.org/ and get the answer. \nBefore taking action, carefully analyze the contents in [Manuals and QA pairs] below.\n        Determine whether [Manuals and QA pairs] contain relevant procedures, constraints, or guidelines that should be followed for this task.\n        If so, follow their guidance accordingly. If not, proceed with a logical and complete approach.\n[Key Guidelines You MUST follow]\n        Before taking any action, analyze the provided [Manuals and QA pairs] as a whole to determine if they contain useful procedures, constraints, or guidelines relevant to this task.\n        - If [Manuals and QA pairs] provide comprehensive guidance, strictly follow their instructions in an ordered and structured manner.\n        - If [Manuals and QA pairs] contain partial but useful information, integrate it into your approach while filling in the gaps logically.\n        - If [Manuals and QA pairs] are entirely irrelevant or insufficient, proceed with the best available method while ensuring completeness.\n\n        [Manuals and QA pairs]\n        Based on the provided retrieval results, it appears that there are no relevant results related to finding the number of figures and tables in the paper \"On the Sentence Embeddings from Pre-trained Language Models.\" The results retrieved contain repetitive content that does not address the task goal or provide any instructions related to finding figures or tables in a paper. Therefore, I will outline a general procedure for a web browsing agent to find the information sought:\n\n```\nTask Goal: How many figures and tables are in the paper \"On the Sentence Embeddings from Pre-trained Language Models\"?\nSteps:\n1. Open your web browser and navigate to the arXiv website at www.arxiv.org.\n2. In the search bar, type the title of the paper \"On the Sentence Embeddings from Pre-trained Language Models\" and press Enter to search.\n3. Locate the paper in the search results and click on the title to open the paper's landing page.\n4. On the paper's page, look for a link to download the PDF of the paper, usually labeled as \"PDF\" or an icon of a document. Click on this link to view or download the PDF.\n5. Open the PDF document of the paper on your device.\n6. Scroll through the PDF document and count the number of figures labeled as \"Figure\" and tables labeled as \"Table\" within the document.\n7. Record the number of figures and tables identified in the paper.\n\nsource: General procedure for finding information in academic papers on arXiv.\n```\n\nThe above steps provide a structured approach to manually finding the number of figures and tables in the specified paper using a web browser and the arXiv platform.Observation: A screenshot and some texts.
