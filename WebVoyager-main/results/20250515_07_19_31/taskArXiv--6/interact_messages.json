    "content": "Imagine you are a robot browsing the web, just like humans. Now you need to complete a task. In each iteration, you will receive an Observation that includes a screenshot of a webpage and some texts. This screenshot will feature Numerical Labels placed in the TOP LEFT corner of each Web Element.\nCarefully analyze the visual information to identify the Numerical Label corresponding to the Web Element that requires interaction, then follow the guidelines and choose one of the following actions:\n1. Click a Web Element.\n2. Delete existing content in a textbox and then type content. \n3. Scroll up or down. Multiple scrolls are allowed to browse the webpage. Pay attention!! The default scroll is the whole window. If the scroll widget is located in a certain area of the webpage, then you have to specify a Web Element in that area. I would hover the mouse there and then scroll.\n4. Wait. Typically used to wait for unfinished webpage processes, with a duration of 5 seconds.\n5. Go back, returning to the previous webpage.\n6. Google, directly jump to the Google search page. When you can't find information in some websites, try starting over with Google.\n7. Answer. This action should only be chosen when all questions in the task have been solved.\n\nCorrespondingly, Action should STRICTLY follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Content]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- Wait\n- GoBack\n- Google\n- ANSWER; [content]\n\nKey Guidelines You MUST follow:\n* Action guidelines *\n1) To input text, NO need to click textbox first, directly type content. After typing, the system automatically hits `ENTER` key. Sometimes you should click the search button to apply search filters. Try to use simple language when searching.  \n2) You must Distinguish between textbox and search button, don't type content into the button! If no textbox is found, you may need to click the search button first before the textbox is displayed. \n3) Execute only one action per iteration. \n4) STRICTLY Avoid repeating the same action if the webpage remains unchanged. You may have selected the wrong web element or numerical label. Continuous use of the Wait is also NOT allowed.\n5) When a complex Task involves multiple questions or steps, select \"ANSWER\" only at the very end, after addressing all of these questions (steps). Flexibly combine your own abilities with the information in the web page. Double check the formatting requirements in the task when ANSWER. \n* Web Browsing Guidelines *\n1) Don't interact with useless web elements like Login, Sign-in, donation that appear in Webpages. Pay attention to Key Web Elements like search textbox and menu.\n2) Vsit video websites like YouTube is allowed BUT you can't play videos. Clicking to download PDF is allowed and will be analyzed by the Assistant API.\n3) Focus on the numerical labels in the TOP LEFT corner of each rectangle (element). Ensure you don't mix them up with other numbers (e.g. Calendar) on the page.\n4) Focus on the date in task, you must look for results that match the date. It may be necessary to find the correct year, month and day at calendar.\n5) Pay attention to the filter and sort functions on the page, which, combined with scroll, can help you solve conditions like 'highest', 'cheapest', 'lowest', 'earliest', etc. Try your best to find the answer that best fits the task.\n\nYour reply should strictly follow the format:\nThought: {Your brief thoughts (briefly summarize the info that will help ANSWER)}\nAction: {One Action format you choose}\n\nThen the User will provide:\nObservation: {A labeled screenshot Given by User}"

Users can search for papers using a combination of keywords and filters such as author, title, abstract, publication year, and subject area. This guide will help you navigate and use these features efficiently.\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n### Accessing the Advanced Search Interface\n\n1. **Open your web browser** and navigate to the arXiv.org website.\n2. **Locate the Search Bar** at the top of the homepage.\n3. **Click on 'Advanced Search'** below the search bar to access the advanced search interface.\n\n### Performing a Search\n\n1. **Enter Keywords:**\n   - In the appropriate fields, enter keywords related to the author, title, or abstract of the papers you wish to find.\n   \n2. **Select Subject Areas:**\n   - Choose relevant subject areas from the list provided, such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, etc.\n\n3. **Set Publication Year:**\n   - Specify the range of publication years to narrow down your search results. Enter the starting and ending year if needed.\n\n4. **Use Logical Operators:**\n   - Select logical operators (AND, OR) to refine your search terms. This helps in narrowing or broadening the scope of your search.\n\n5. **Set Number of Results:**\n   - Decide the number of search results you want to be displayed per page, e.g., 10, 20, or 50 hits per page.\n\n### Executing the Search\n\n1. **Click 'Search':**\n   - After entering all desired criteria, click the 'Search' button to perform the search.\n   \n2. **Review Results:**\n   - Browse through the results displayed on your screen. Use pagination to navigate through multiple pages of results if necessary.\n\n### Resetting the Search Fields\n\n1. **Click 'Reset':**\n   - If you want to start a new search with different criteria, click the 'Reset' button to clear all input fields.\n\n### Tips for Effective Searching\n\n- Use specific keywords and combine them with logical operators for more precise results.\n- Regularly update your search filters, such as publication year, to access the most recent research.\n- Experiment with different combinations of fields to explore various aspects of the literature.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently utilize the advanced search features on arXiv.org to find the academic papers most relevant to your needs. Tailor your searches using the available filters and options to maximize the effectiveness of your research efforts.Observation: A screenshot and some texts. (Omitted in context.)"
