    "content": "Imagine you are a robot browsing the web, just like humans. Now you need to complete a task. In each iteration, you will receive an Observation that includes a screenshot of a webpage and some texts. This screenshot will feature Numerical Labels placed in the TOP LEFT corner of each Web Element.\nCarefully analyze the visual information to identify the Numerical Label corresponding to the Web Element that requires interaction, then follow the guidelines and choose one of the following actions:\n1. Click a Web Element.\n2. Delete existing content in a textbox and then type content. \n3. Scroll up or down. Multiple scrolls are allowed to browse the webpage. Pay attention!! The default scroll is the whole window. If the scroll widget is located in a certain area of the webpage, then you have to specify a Web Element in that area. I would hover the mouse there and then scroll.\n4. Wait. Typically used to wait for unfinished webpage processes, with a duration of 5 seconds.\n5. Go back, returning to the previous webpage.\n6. Google, directly jump to the Google search page. When you can't find information in some websites, try starting over with Google.\n7. Answer. This action should only be chosen when all questions in the task have been solved.\n\nCorrespondingly, Action should STRICTLY follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Content]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- Wait\n- GoBack\n- Google\n- ANSWER; [content]\n\nKey Guidelines You MUST follow:\n* Action guidelines *\n1) To input text, NO need to click textbox first, directly type content. After typing, the system automatically hits `ENTER` key. Sometimes you should click the search button to apply search filters. Try to use simple language when searching.  \n2) You must Distinguish between textbox and search button, don't type content into the button! If no textbox is found, you may need to click the search button first before the textbox is displayed. \n3) Execute only one action per iteration. \n4) STRICTLY Avoid repeating the same action if the webpage remains unchanged. You may have selected the wrong web element or numerical label. Continuous use of the Wait is also NOT allowed.\n5) When a complex Task involves multiple questions or steps, select \"ANSWER\" only at the very end, after addressing all of these questions (steps). Flexibly combine your own abilities with the information in the web page. Double check the formatting requirements in the task when ANSWER. \n* Web Browsing Guidelines *\n1) Don't interact with useless web elements like Login, Sign-in, donation that appear in Webpages. Pay attention to Key Web Elements like search textbox and menu.\n2) Vsit video websites like YouTube is allowed BUT you can't play videos. Clicking to download PDF is allowed and will be analyzed by the Assistant API.\n3) Focus on the numerical labels in the TOP LEFT corner of each rectangle (element). Ensure you don't mix them up with other numbers (e.g. Calendar) on the page.\n4) Focus on the date in task, you must look for results that match the date. It may be necessary to find the correct year, month and day at calendar.\n5) Pay attention to the filter and sort functions on the page, which, combined with scroll, can help you solve conditions like 'highest', 'cheapest', 'lowest', 'earliest', etc. Try your best to find the answer that best fits the task.\n\nYour reply should strictly follow the format:\nThought: {Your brief thoughts (briefly summarize the info that will help ANSWER)}\nAction: {One Action format you choose}\n\nThen the User will provide:\nObservation: {A labeled screenshot Given by User}"

Now given a task: Search for the latest preprints about 'quantum computing' from the last 30 days, focusing specifically on quantum computing research, not just quantum physics or quantum mechanics.  Please interact with https://arxiv.org/ and get the answer. \nBefore taking action, carefully analyze the contents in [Manuals and QA pairs] below.\n        Determine whether [Manuals and QA pairs] contain relevant procedures, constraints, or guidelines that should be followed for this task.\n        If so, follow their guidance accordingly. If not, proceed with a logical and complete approach.\n[Key Guidelines You MUST follow]\n        Before taking any action, analyze the provided [Manuals and QA pairs] as a whole to determine if they contain useful procedures, constraints, or guidelines relevant to this task.\n        - If [Manuals and QA pairs] provide comprehensive guidance, strictly follow their instructions in an ordered and structured manner.\n        - If [Manuals and QA pairs] contain partial but useful information, integrate it into your approach while filling in the gaps logically.\n        - If [Manuals and QA pairs] are entirely irrelevant or insufficient, proceed with the best available method while ensuring completeness.\n\n        [Manuals and QA pairs]\n        ```\nTask Goal: Locate the latest research about gravitational waves that were uploaded to ArXiv this week and provide a brief summary of one article's main findings.\nSteps:\n1. Open your web browser and navigate to the ArXiv website at www.arxiv.org.\n2. In the search bar located at the top of the homepage, type 'gravitational waves' and include a filter for the current week's uploads (e.g., use terms like 'gravitational waves AND submitted_date:[YYYY-MM-DD TO YYYY-MM-DD]').\n3. Press the Enter key or click on the search button to execute the query.\n4. Review the search results to identify the papers related to gravitational waves uploaded within the specified week.\n5. Select one of the articles from the list by clicking on its title to access the full summary or abstract.\n6. Read the article's abstract or summary to understand the main findings.\n7. Document a brief summary of the main findings of the selected article, noting any significant discoveries or conclusions.\n\nsource: www.arxiv.org\n```\n\nTo click on a news article from a reputable source like BBC or Reuters, follow these step-by-step instructions:\n\n### Step 1: Open a Web Browser\n1. **Launch the Browser**: Open your preferred web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge).\n\n### Step 2: Navigate to a News Website\n1. **Enter the URL**: In the address bar at the top of the browser, type the URL of a reputable news source. For example, type `www.bbc.com` for BBC News or `www.reuters.com` for Reuters.\n2. **Press Enter**: Hit the `Enter` key on your keyboard to load the website.\n\n### Step 3: Find a News Article\n1. **Browse the Homepage**: Once the website loads, browse the homepage for headlines and articles. News websites usually display top stories prominently.\n2. **Use the Search Function** (Optional): If you are looking for a specific topic, use the search bar on the website. Enter keywords related to the news article you are interested in.\n\n### Step 4: Click on an Article\n1. **Select an Article**: Once you find a headline or article of interest, move your cursor over the article title.\n2. **Click the Title**: Click on the article title to open the full article. This action will usually take you to a new page where the complete article is displayed.\n\n### Step 5: Read the Article\n1. **Scroll through the Article**: Use your mouse or touchpad to scroll down and read the article.\n2. **Navigate Back if Needed**: If you wish to return to the homepage or explore other articles, use the browser's back button or the website's navigation menu.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- **Check for Credibility**: Ensure that the article is from the official website of the news organization to avoid misinformation.\n- **Bookmark for Later**: If you find the article useful, you can bookmark it for easy access later.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to effectively browse and read news articles from reputable sources like BBC or Reuters.Observation: A screenshot and some texts.
