    "content": "Imagine you are a robot browsing the web, just like humans. Now you need to complete a task. In each iteration, you will receive an Observation that includes a screenshot of a webpage and some texts. This screenshot will feature Numerical Labels placed in the TOP LEFT corner of each Web Element.\nCarefully analyze the visual information to identify the Numerical Label corresponding to the Web Element that requires interaction, then follow the guidelines and choose one of the following actions:\n1. Click a Web Element.\n2. Delete existing content in a textbox and then type content. \n3. Scroll up or down. Multiple scrolls are allowed to browse the webpage. Pay attention!! The default scroll is the whole window. If the scroll widget is located in a certain area of the webpage, then you have to specify a Web Element in that area. I would hover the mouse there and then scroll.\n4. Wait. Typically used to wait for unfinished webpage processes, with a duration of 5 seconds.\n5. Go back, returning to the previous webpage.\n6. Google, directly jump to the Google search page. When you can't find information in some websites, try starting over with Google.\n7. Answer. This action should only be chosen when all questions in the task have been solved.\n\nCorrespondingly, Action should STRICTLY follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Content]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- Wait\n- GoBack\n- Google\n- ANSWER; [content]\n\nKey Guidelines You MUST follow:\n* Action guidelines *\n1) To input text, NO need to click textbox first, directly type content. After typing, the system automatically hits `ENTER` key. Sometimes you should click the search button to apply search filters. Try to use simple language when searching.  \n2) You must Distinguish between textbox and search button, don't type content into the button! If no textbox is found, you may need to click the search button first before the textbox is displayed. \n3) Execute only one action per iteration. \n4) STRICTLY Avoid repeating the same action if the webpage remains unchanged. You may have selected the wrong web element or numerical label. Continuous use of the Wait is also NOT allowed.\n5) When a complex Task involves multiple questions or steps, select \"ANSWER\" only at the very end, after addressing all of these questions (steps). Flexibly combine your own abilities with the information in the web page. Double check the formatting requirements in the task when ANSWER. \n* Web Browsing Guidelines *\n1) Don't interact with useless web elements like Login, Sign-in, donation that appear in Webpages. Pay attention to Key Web Elements like search textbox and menu.\n2) Vsit video websites like YouTube is allowed BUT you can't play videos. Clicking to download PDF is allowed and will be analyzed by the Assistant API.\n3) Focus on the numerical labels in the TOP LEFT corner of each rectangle (element). Ensure you don't mix them up with other numbers (e.g. Calendar) on the page.\n4) Focus on the date in task, you must look for results that match the date. It may be necessary to find the correct year, month and day at calendar.\n5) Pay attention to the filter and sort functions on the page, which, combined with scroll, can help you solve conditions like 'highest', 'cheapest', 'lowest', 'earliest', etc. Try your best to find the answer that best fits the task.\n\nYour reply should strictly follow the format:\nThought: {Your brief thoughts (briefly summarize the info that will help ANSWER)}\nAction: {One Action format you choose}\n\nThen the User will provide:\nObservation: {A labeled screenshot Given by User}"

Now given a task: Search for the latest preprints about 'quantum computing' from the last 30 days, focusing specifically on quantum computing research, not just quantum physics or quantum mechanics.  Please interact with https://arxiv.org/ and get the answer. \nBefore taking action, carefully analyze the contents in [Manuals and QA pairs] below.\n        Determine whether [Manuals and QA pairs] contain relevant procedures, constraints, or guidelines that should be followed for this task.\n        If so, follow their guidance accordingly. If not, proceed with a logical and complete approach.\n[Key Guidelines You MUST follow]\n        Before taking any action, analyze the provided [Manuals and QA pairs] as a whole to determine if they contain useful procedures, constraints, or guidelines relevant to this task.\n        - If [Manuals and QA pairs] provide comprehensive guidance, strictly follow their instructions in an ordered and structured manner.\n        - If [Manuals and QA pairs] contain partial but useful information, integrate it into your approach while filling in the gaps logically.\n        - If [Manuals and QA pairs] are entirely irrelevant or insufficient, proceed with the best available method while ensuring completeness.\n\n        [Manuals and QA pairs]\n        ```\nTask Goal: Look up the most recent papers related to 'cs.CL', select one and show its abstract.\nSteps:\n1. Open your web browser and navigate to the arXiv website at www.arxiv.org.\n2. Locate the search interface on the homepage.\n3. In the search bar, type the query 'cs.CL' to filter papers related to the Computation and Language subject area.\n4. Use the filters available to sort the results by the most recent papers. You may need to specify the date range or select 'Sort by date' if available.\n5. Click on the title of the most recent paper that appears in the search results to open its detailed page.\n6. On the paper's detailed page, locate and read the abstract section to understand the paper's content.\n\nsource: arXiv_enhanced.md\n```\n\n# arXiv Advanced Search Instruction Manual\n\nThis manual provides a step-by-step guide to using the advanced search interface on arXiv.org. The advanced search feature allows users to perform detailed searches for academic papers across various subject areas.\n\n## Accessing the Advanced Search Interface\n\n1. **Navigate to arXiv.org**: Open your preferred web browser and enter the URL [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org) in the address bar.\n\n2. **Locate the Search Bar**: On the homepage, find the search bar at the top of the page.\n\n3. **Access Advanced Search**: Click on the \"Advanced Search\" link, usually located near the search bar, to open the advanced search interface.\n\n## Performing an Advanced Search\n\n1. **Select Search Criteria**:\n   - **Author**: Enter the author's name to find papers written by a specific individual.\n   - **Title**: Enter keywords from the title of the work you are searching for.\n   - **Abstract**: Use keywords from the paper's abstract for a broader search.\n\n2. **Choose Subject Areas**:\n   - Select one or more subject areas from the available list, such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Quantitative Biology, Quantitative Finance, and Statistics.\n\n3. **Set Publication Filters**:\n   - Enter the range of publication years to filter the search results by the desired time frame.\n\n4. **Use Logical Operators**:\n   - Choose between logical operators \"AND\" or \"OR\" to combine search terms effectively. \"AND\" narrows results to papers containing all terms, while \"OR\" broadens results to papers containing any of the terms.\n\n5. **Set Results Display**:\n   - Specify the number of hits per page to control the volume of search results displayed at once.\n\n## Executing the Search\n\n1. **Perform the Search**:\n   - After setting all your criteria, click the \"Search\" button to execute the search and view the results.\n\n2. **Reset Search Fields** (Optional):\n   - If you wish to start over, click the \"Reset\" button to clear all fields and begin a new search.\n\n## Viewing and Interpreting Results\n\n1. **Review Search Results**:\n   - Browse through the list of search results. Each entry typically includes the title, authors, abstract, and a link to the full paper.\n\n2. **Access Full Text**:\n   - Click on the paper's title or the provided link to access the full text and additional details about the publication.\n\n## Tips for Effective Searching\n\n- **Be Specific**: Use specific keywords to narrow down search results.\n- **Combine Keywords**: Utilize a combination of author, title, and abstract keywords for more comprehensive searches.\n- **Adjust Filters**: Experiment with different logical operators and publication year ranges to refine search results.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively utilize the advanced search feature on arXiv.org to find academic papers relevant to your research needs.Observation: A screenshot and some texts.
