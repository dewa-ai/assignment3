# ArXiv User Manual for WebVoyager

This manual outlines the standard steps for searching research papers and downloading PDFs on [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org). It is intended to support agents in completing tasks such as paper search, category filtering, and file retrieval.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open ArXiv
- Navigate to [https://arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org)

---

### Step 2: Perform a Paper Search
- Locate the **search bar** (typically at the top).
- Type in the **paper title**, **keywords**, or **arXiv ID** (e.g., `2301.12345`).
- Press the **Search** button or hit `Enter`.

---

### Step 3: Filter Results (Optional)
- Use the **left-side filters** to narrow down results:
  - **By Category**: e.g., `cs`, `math`, `physics`
  - **By Date**: e.g., submissions in the last week or month

> Example: To filter for Computer Science papers, check the box labeled `cs`.

---

### Step 4: Identify Relevant Papers
- Review the result titles and abstracts.
- Each entry typically includes:
  - **Title**
  - **Authors**
  - **Submission Date**
  - **Abstract**
  - **PDF / Other formats** links

---

### Step 5: Download PDF
- Click on the **"PDF"** button or link next to the relevant result.
- If prompted, the agent should follow redirects or handle pop-ups.

---

## Notes and Tips

- **arXiv IDs** follow the pattern `YYMM.NNNNN` (e.g., `2310.01234`) and are globally unique.
- Not all tasks require filters â€” agents should skip filter steps if the search is already specific.
- If the paper is not found on the first page, scroll down or navigate to the **next page** of results.
- Some paper titles or IDs may yield **multiple entries** (e.g., versioned uploads). Choose the most recent.

## Common Issues and Workarounds

- **Missing Search Button**: If the search button is not immediately visible, typing and pressing `Enter` works.
- **Unresponsive Filters**: Wait a few seconds or scroll the filter panel into view before clicking.
- **Popup Modals**: Close popups if they obscure the search or result list.
